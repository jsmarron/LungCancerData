# Graphical Outputs
Early TCGA Data with RNAseq read depth curves for 4 genes. 

Data from Matt Wilkerson, Oct. 2011. 

Various visualizations, for each of the 4 genes (indicated inthe file names:
* PIK3CA
* CDKN2A
* P10
* STK11

For each gene analyses, indexed as ip# in file names:
* ip1:  Raw data overlay, read depth curves, rotating Matlab colors
* ip2:  log10 data overlay, read depth curves, rotating Matlab colors
* ip3:  PC scores scatterplot matrix,  rotating Matlab colors
* ip4:  PC scores scatterplot matrix,  manually brushed colors
* ip5:  log10 data overlay, read depth curves, manually brushed colors
* ip6:  FDA, via curvdatSM, manually brushed colors

Apparent Interesting Featurea are:  
* PIC3CA:  blues much smaller at beginning, PC2 (degradation?)
* CDKN2A:  Reds:  Undexpressed    Blues & Blacks:  Alternate splicing
* P10:  ???
* STK11:  Reds:  Undexpressed    Blues bigger at beginning & end, PC2
